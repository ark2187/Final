# Border Crossings Report

## Motivations

Immigration has been a hotly contested issue during Trump's presidency. Marking his words of building a "big, beautiful wall" in 2016, President Donald Trump got the green light from The Supreme Court in 2019 and $2.5 billion from the Pentagon's budget to building up the U.S.-Mexico border.

Ironically, despite the promise of his campaign to stop illegal immigration and build a strong bolder, the Trump administration faced a great challenge since the number of apprehensions significantly soar. For example, in August 2018, one-month total apprehensions was the highest on record and an 80 percent increase from July 2018. This trend is quite contrasting to the border crossing situation under the Obama administration. From 2008 to 2016, the yearly apprehensions on the Southwest border declined by 35 percent. 

Although the data we found on border crossings on Kaggle are recorded, legal, and do not run into 2020, we were interested in looking at border crossing trends because of this issue. Understanding the change in legal border crossing is crucial when considering the United States and Mexico's mutually dependent relationship in many aspects: including economy, separated immigrants' family issues, etc. Indeed, Mexico has remained the United States' second-largest export market since 1995, with exports totaling $242 billion in 2017.This analysis will help us understand and show how the border crossings play into life (e.g. movement of goods, commuting, holiday travel).

```


### Source

Primary data source: [Border Crossing Entry Data](https://www.kaggle.com/akhilv11/border-crossing-entry-data) 

### Cleaning 

#### *Variables of Interest*

**Outcome**
`value`: A count of the number of crossings for each `measure` type at each `port_name_state` in each `month` of each `year`

**Predictors**

`state`: The state in which the border was located  
`port_code`: The code for the port in which the border entry took place  
`border`: Either the US-Canada or the US-Mexico border  
`month`: Month 1-12 in which the crossing took place  
`month_name`: Month name (Jan-Dec) in which the crossing took place  
`year`: Year from 2000 to 2018 in which the crossing took place  
`measure`: The type of vehicle or non-vehicle utilized in the border crossing. Potential entries include `r border_crossing_df %>% pull(measure) %>% unique()`  
`long`: Longitude of the port of the crossing
`lat`: Latitude of the port of the crossing
`port_name_state`: The port name and state for which the crossing took place. Some ports had the same name so this variable was created to append `state` as well.
`vehicle`:
