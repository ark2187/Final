## **Motivations**

Immigration has been a hotly contested issue during Trump's presidency. Marking his words of building a "big, beautiful wall" in 2016, President Donald Trump got the green light from The Supreme Court in 2019 and $2.5 billion from the Pentagon's budget to building up the U.S.-Mexico border.

Ironically, despite the promise of his campaign to stop illegal immigration and build a strong bolder, the Trump administration faced a great challenge since the number of apprehensions significantly soar. For example, in August 2018, one-month total apprehensions was the highest on record and an 80 percent increase from July 2018. This trend is quite contrasting to the border crossing situation under the Obama administration. From 2008 to 2016, the yearly apprehensions on the Southwest border declined by 35 percent. 

Although the data we found on border crossings on Kaggle are recorded, legal, and do not run into 2020, we were interested in looking at border crossing trends because of this issue. Understanding the change in legal border crossing is crucial when considering the United States and Mexico's mutually dependent relationship in many aspects: including economy, separated immigrants' family issues, etc. Indeed, Mexico has remained the United States' second-largest export market since 1995, with exports totaling $242 billion in 2017.This analysis will help us understand and show how the border crossings play into life (e.g. movement of goods, commuting, holiday travel).

The following resources are a sample of what inspired this project<br>
* Trump wall: How much has he actually built?, BBC News, October 2020: [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46824649)  <br>

## **Initial Questions**

* What is the distribution of recorded crossings between the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders?
* Is there a time-trend of recorded crossings when comparing each year's record? Or Is there a noticeable change in total number of recorded crossings?
* How busy are the busiest ports? Where are the busiest ports?
* Is there a time of the year when there are the most crossings? Are there holiday trends?
* What types of vehicles are crossing the borders the most? For a few ports (including Canadian ports)?
* Are there seasonal goods or commerce trends? (E.g., more private care cross US-Canada in the summer and maybe more truck crossings from Mexico in produce seasons.)

### Source

Primary data source: [Border Crossing Entry Data](https://www.kaggle.com/akhilv11/border-crossing-entry-data) <br>

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Border Crossing Data is summary statistics for border-crossing returning the the U.S. at the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level. Data are collected at ports of entry by U.S. and include the number of veheciles, containers, passengers, or pedestriants.

### Cleaning 

#### *Variables of Interest*

**Outcome**
`value`: A count of the number of crossings for each `measure` type at each `port_name_state` in each `month` of each `year`

**Predictors**

`state`: The state in which the border was located  
`port_code`: The code for the port in which the border entry took place  
`border`: Either the US-Canada or the US-Mexico border  
`month`: Month 1-12 in which the crossing took place  
`month_name`: Month name (Jan-Dec) in which the crossing took place  
`year`: Year from 2000 to 2018 in which the crossing took place  
`measure`: The type of vehicle or non-vehicle utilized in the border crossing. Potential entries include `r border_crossing_df %>% pull(measure) %>% unique()`  
`long`: Longitude of the port of the crossing
`lat`: Latitude of the port of the crossing
`port_name_state`: The port name and state for which the crossing took place. Some ports had the same name so this variable was created to append `state` as well.
`vehicle`: 

## **Exploratory Analysis** 

In the Exploratory Analyses tab, you can observe <br>
* change in the number of border crossing across years <br>
* seasonal trend <br>
* difference between each vehicle type.
